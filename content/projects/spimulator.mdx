In this project, I created a GUI for my MIPS emulator, which you can see above.
In it, the user can enter assembly code on the left, which is then compiled by my program into 
the relevant machine language, displayed in hex. The user can then choose to run the program, 
which fully runs through the program, or choose to step through the program one instruction at 
a time, with the registers updating in real time and a text description of the instruction executed 
on the right. These registers can be changed so that they display their value in hex, binary, or 
decimal, allowing for easy debugging.

The program also has a space for output because syscall works. The supported syscall options 
are: $v0 = 1, 4, 5, and 10. This allows the user to practice proper conventions like exiting
 the program and printing numbers and strings. Along these lines, the user is able to enter 
 static data into the ".data" section, with the data types ".byte", ".half", ".word", ".asciiz", 
 and ".space" supported. There are only 1,024 bytes in the available memory, an arbitrary number 
 I chose to prevent the program from taking up too much memory, while still having enough memory 
 to do small programs.

The supported core instructions are: addi, add, sub, and, lui, sll, srl, sra, slt, beq, bne, j, jal, 
jr, mult, mflo, mfhi, addu, or, nor, addiu, lw, sw, andi, ori.

Additionally, proper branching and jumping is supported, with branching using relative positions 
and jumping absolute positions. Labels are able to be used to quickly name jump points, to easily 
allow the assembler to deal with the possible change in locations.

This is important because the assembler supports the three most frequent pseudoinstructions: 
li, la, move. It does this by replacing the pseudoinstruction with the corresponding core 
instructions in a preprocessing step, making so that the output of the assembler resembles 
the output of another assembler like spim.

Finally, the program has support for exceptions like errors occuring in assembling via incorrect 
syntax in the inputted code, and integer overflow, which it then prints to the output console.
